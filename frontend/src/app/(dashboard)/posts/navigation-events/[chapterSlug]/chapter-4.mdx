# Pros and cons

The advantage if this approach is that we can use the same component in different places,
and trigger url changes from this component, without the need to explicitly tell the component
how the url change should happen. In general, I like to have dumb components with simple code,
and this approach promotes this. Finally, by centralizing the processing of navigation events,
we can expect more consistency in the url changes than when this is left to the components.

The downside is that the indirection makes the code for handling navigation less explicit. Also,
because there are more moving part, this approach is more complex then simply updating the url
in the component.

# Conclusion

I've introduced an approach for decoupling the handling of navigation events from the components.
I'm still experimenting with this approach, so far it seems to work well, but I expect my
thoughts on this topic to evolve, so I wil probably return to this topic later.
