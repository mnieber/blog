# Goals

To explain how events that lead to a url change can be generated in a React component
but handled outside of it.

# Rationale

I like to reflect the application state in the url, for two reasons:

- it tells the user where they are in the application;
- it allows the user to save the url and come back to the same page later.

Reflecting the application state in the url implies that our application must do some kind of
url management. In particular, our application needs to handle the following concerns:

- we need a mechanism for changing the url in response to user actions.
- we must update the application state in response to changes in the url, and vice versa;

I will illustrate how these challenges can be tackled using two techniques: the navigation handler
and the router effect.

A navigation handler is used to decouple views from url changes. A view no longer changes the url
directly but instead makes a request to the navigation handler. For example, imagine that our
application has a "archived blog-posts" view and a "current blog-posts" view. Both views can use the
same `BlogPostListView` component that makes `navigateToBlogPost` requests, and these requests can
produce different url-changes in each context.

A router effect is a render component that is inserted into the routing
schema. Since the router effect is aware of the current view, it can respond to the application state
changes that are generated this view and update the url accordingly.

# Overview

In the next section I will first explain how I do (ordinary) routing in my application. This is a preparation
for the subsequent section in which I explain how url management is tackled. In the final section I will
discuss the pros and cons of this approach.
