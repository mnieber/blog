# Goals

To explain how events that lead to a url change can be generated in a React component
but handled outside of it.

# Rationale

I like to reflect the application state in the url, for two reasons:

- it tells the user where they are in the application;
- it allows the user to save the url and come back to the same page later.

How should we manage updates to the url? A practical choice is to do this inside React components.
For example, when the user presses a button, then the component responds by updating the url.
However, I prefer a more decoupled approach in which components are wrapped in a so-called
navigation layer. When a component fires a navigation event then the nearest navigation layer
either processes it (this usually results in a url change) or passes it to the next layer.
Since navigation layers are aware of the page that the user is on, they are in a better position
to make the correct url changes.

# Overview

In the next section I will first explain how I manage routes in my application. This is a preparation
for the subsequent section in which I explain how how navigation events are fired and
how they are processed. In the final section I will discuss the pros and cons of this approach.
