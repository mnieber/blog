# Goals

In this post I will explain how url-changes can be requested in React components but handled outside of it.

## Sample code

There is a sample application, annotated with comments, that explains the approach. Enter the following commands to run it:

export const code1 = `
git clone git@github.com:mnieber/blog-sample-apps.git
cd blog-sample-apps
yarn navHandler-sample
# Open the browser at http://localhost:3000
`;

<CodeSnippet
  lang="bash"
  addMb
  code={code1}
/>

## Rationale

I like to reflect the application state in the url, for two reasons:

- it tells the user where they are in the application;
- it allows the user to save the url and come back to the same page later.

To achieve this our application must do some kind of url management:

- we must update the url in response to user actions. For example, when the user clicks on a folder in
  a map-view then we need to navigate to that folder;
- we must update the url when the application state changes, and vice versa. For example, when
  the user renames a folder, then we need to update the url accordingly.

I tackle these challenges using two techniques: the navigation handler and the router effect.

A **navigation handler** is used to decouple components from url changes. In the given example, a `MapTreeView`
can detect the mouse-click on a folder, but it cannot decide the url-change that must happen (because the
same `MapTreeView` could be used on different pages). Instead, it will send a `navToFolder` request to the
navigation handler, that takes care of the url update in a context-dependent way.

A **router effect** is a render component that is inserted into the routing schema. Since a router effect is only
rendered if it matches the current url, it knows which page the user is on. Therefore, it can synchronize the
application state with the url in a context-dependent way.

In both cases, "context-dependent" is the key term, and we will come back to it.

# Outlook

In the next section I will first explain how I do (ordinary) routing in my application. This is a preparation
for the subsequent section in which I explain how url management is tackled using a navigation handler and
router effects. Then I will discuss how so-called url-effects can be used to synchronize the application state
with the url and vice versa. In the final section I will discuss the pros and cons of my approach.
