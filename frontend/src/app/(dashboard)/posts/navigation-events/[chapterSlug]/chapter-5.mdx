# Pros and cons

We've seen how do context-depend url updates using a navigation handler. This has the advantage
that we can use the same component in different places, without the need to explicitly tell the component
how url changes should happen. In general, I like to have dumb components with simple code,
and this approach promotes this. Moreover, by using centralized navigation functions (such as
`navToPpost`) it's easier to enforce consistency in the url changes than when this is left to the components.
Finally, since we don't have to pass any details related to url management to the components,
there is less prop drilling and therefore less code clutter.

The downside is that the indirection makes the code for handling navigation less explicit. When we call
`navToPost` then a dynamic lookup is performed to determine which url change must be performed. This
is more complex then simply updating the url in the component. We could simplify `navToPost` by directly
navigating to a particular url, without the dynamic look up (of course, this means we loose
the benefits provided by the navigation handler). In general, we can start with this direct approach when adding
a navigation function, and only extend the navigation handler when we need the dynamic behaviour.

# Conclusion

I've introduced an approach for decoupling the handling of navigation events from the components. I've also
shown how the url and application can be synchronized using url effects. I'm still experimenting with this
approach, but so far it seems to work well. I expect my thoughts on this topic to evolve, so I wil probably
return to this topic later.
