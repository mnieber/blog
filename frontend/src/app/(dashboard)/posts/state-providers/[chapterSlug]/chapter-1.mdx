# Goals

In this article I will explain how we can get state from the server, store it locally and provide it
to the React components that render the information.

# Caveats

The approach presented in this article is experimental. It has worked well for me in practice, but
I expect that for many people it's too elaborate to consider using it. That said, I hope you find
this article interesting for the ideas that it puts forward.

# Rationale and overview

In the post about [skandha](/posts/skandha/chapter-1) I've explained how we can store data in containers
that add behaviours such as selection and filtering. A complete solution for managing server
state and local state requires more than this:

- We must decide how the fetching of server data is triggered. E.g. do we fetch data when the React
  component that needs the data is mounted?
- How can we determine the loading state of a resource that is used in some React component? We
  may show a special loading state (e.g. a spinner) if the resource is currently loading or
  updating;
- How can we share state among different React components?

This article describes how I solve these issues. I will start by explaining how resource states are tracked.
Then, I will explain how state providers are responsible for fetching the data and exposing it to the
React components.
