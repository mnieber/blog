# The ResourceState class

A resource state is a value that indicates whether the resource is loading or updating. Since tracking resource
states is not trival, it's a good idea to only track the resources that require it. We'll return to this idea
in the next chapter.

## Internal and external resource states

We can store a resource state externally (in some lookup table) or internally in the resource itself. I prefer to
store it internally for several reasons:

- it reduces the amount of bookkeeping: if the resource is deleted then there is no need to remove its resource state
  from the external storage;
- it removes the need for a unique id that we can use to store the resource state for a resource;
- I find it less elegant to make React components dependent on a global storage of resource states.

To add a resource state, I'm using a `initRS(resource)` function. This function is implemented as follows:

export const code1 = `
export const symbolRS = Symbol('ResourceState');

export const initRS = (resource: any) => {
  if (resource && !resource[symbolRS]) {
    resource[symbolRS] = new ResourceState();
  }
  return resource;
};
`;

# Adding sources to a ResourceState

Instead of storing a value such `loading` or `updating` in the `ResourceState` class, I'm storing a list of sources
from which the final state (`loading` or `updating`) is derived. This approach makes it possible to construct
a pipeline of resource states. For example, the state of a `todo-item` resource can be derived from the state of
a `todo-list` resource, that can be derived from a `user-profile` resource. By using such a pipeline it's easier
to ensure that the final resource state is correct, and not based on stale data.

Here is the source code for the `ResourceState` class:

export const code2 = `
export type ConditionT = () => boolean | undefined;

export type SourceT = {
  state: string;
  condition: ConditionT;
  name: string;
};

export class ResourceState {
  name?: string = undefined;
  sources: SourceT[] = [];

  addSource(source: SourceT) {
    // Implementation simplified for brevity
    this.sources.push(source);
  }

  removeSource(state: string, name: string) {
    // Implementation omitted for brevity
  }

  get value() {
    const result: string[] = [];
    for (const source of this.sources) {
      if (source.condition()) {
        const state = source.state;
        if (!result.includes(state)) result.push(state);
      }
    }
    return result;
  }

  constructor() {
    makeObservable(this, {
      addSource: action,
      removeSource: action,
      sources: observable,
      value: computed,
    });
  }
}
`;

<CodeSnippet
  title="resourceStates/ResourceState.ts"
  code={code1}
/>

As we can see, the value of a `ResourceState` is an array that contains all resource states of all sources for which
`source.condition()` returns true.

# The null resource state

While a resource is loading, we don't have it. Therefore, we cannot access the resource state via the resource instance.
Instead, I use `null` to represent a loading resource. When a React component receives a resource, it can be either
`null` (which means that the resource is loading), or some object (that has a resource state), or `undefined` (which
means that the resource is unavailable, but not loading).

Here is the code for getting the resource state of a resource:

export const code3 = `
import { symbolRS } from '/src/resourceStates/ResourceState';

export const loadingResource = null;

export const getState = <StateT = string>(
  resource: any
): StateT[] => {
  if (resource === undefined)  return [];
  return resource === loadingResource
    ? ['loading']
    : resource[symbolRS].value;
};

export const isUpdating = (resource: any) =>
  getState(resource).includes('updating');

export const isLoading = (resource: any) =>
  getState(resource).includes('loading');

export const isReady = (resource: any) => {
  const state = getState(resource);
  return resource
    && !state.includes('loading')
    && !state.includes('updating');
};

export const isUndefined = (resource: any) =>
  resource === undefined || getState(resource).length === 0;
`;

# What's next

In the next chapter we'll look at how state-providers fetch data and expose
it to React components, including the resource states.
