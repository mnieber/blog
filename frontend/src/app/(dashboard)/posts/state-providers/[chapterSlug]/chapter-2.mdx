# The ResourceState class

A resource state is a value that indicates whether the resource is loading or updating. Since tracking resource
states is not trival, it's a good idea to only track the resources that require it. We'll return to this idea
in the next chapter.

## Internal and external resource states

We can store a resource state externally (in some lookup table) or internally in the resource itself. I prefer to
store it internally for several reasons:

- it reduces the amount of bookkeeping: if the resource is deleted then there is no need to remove its resource state
  from the external storage;
- it removes the need for a globally unique id that we can use to store the resource state for a resource;
- I find it less elegant to make React components dependent on a global storage of resource states.

To add a resource state, I'm using a `initRS(resource)` function. This function adds the internal resource state if
the resource doesn't have one:

export const code1 = `
export const symbolRS = Symbol('ResourceState');

export const initRS = (resource: any) => {
  if (resource && !resource[symbolRS]) {
    resource[symbolRS] = new ResourceState();
  }
  return resource;
};
`;

# Adding sources to a ResourceState

Instead of storing a value such `loading` or `updating` in the `ResourceState` class, I'm storing a list of sources
from which the final state (`loading` or `updating`) is derived. This approach makes it possible to construct
a pipeline of resource states. For example, the state of a `todo` resource can be derived from the state of
a `todolist` resource, that can be derived from a `todolists` resource. By using such a pipeline it's easier
to ensure that the final resource state is correct, and not based on stale data.

Here is the source code for the `ResourceState` class:

export const code2 = `
export type ConditionT = () => boolean | undefined;

export type SourceT = {
  state: string;
  condition: ConditionT;
  name: string;
};

export class ResourceState {
  name?: string = undefined;
  sources: SourceT[] = [];

  addSource(source: SourceT) {
    // Implementation simplified for brevity
    this.sources.push(source);
  }

  removeSource(state: string, name: string) {
    // Implementation omitted for brevity
  }

  get value() {
    const result: string[] = [];
    for (const source of this.sources) {
      if (source.condition()) {
        const state = source.state;
        if (!result.includes(state)) result.push(state);
      }
    }
    return result;
  }

  constructor() {
    makeObservable(this, {
      addSource: action,
      removeSource: action,
      sources: observable,
      value: computed,
    });
  }
}
`;

<CodeSnippet
  title="resourceStates/ResourceState.ts"
  code={code2}
/>

As we can see, the value of a `ResourceState` is an array that contains all resource states of all sources for which
`source.condition()` returns true.

## The updateSources function

The `updateSources` function is a helper function that is used as follows:

export const code3 = `
const resources = updateSources(
  { resource: myTodolist },
  ['loading', () => isQueryLoading(getTodolists), 'getTodolists'],
)
`;

<CodeSnippet
  title="example.ts"
  code={code3}
/>

This function does the following:

- it calls `initRS` on the resource (in this case: `myTodolist`) to create a resource state;
- it adds sources to the resource state. In this case, it "states" that the resource is loading if the `getTodolists`
  query is loading.

# The null resource state

While a resource is loading, we don't have it. Therefore, we cannot access the resource state via the resource instance.
Instead, I use `null` to represent a loading resource. When a React component receives a resource, it can be either
`null` (which means that the resource is loading), or some object (that has a resource state), or `undefined` (which
means that the resource is unavailable, but not in a `loading` state).

Here is the code for getting the resource state of a resource:

export const code4 = `
import { symbolRS } from '/src/resourceStates/ResourceState';

export const loadingResource = null;

export const getState = <StateT = string>(
  resource: any
): StateT[] => {
  if (resource === undefined)  return [];
  return resource === loadingResource
    ? ['loading']
    : resource[symbolRS].value;
};

export const isUpdating = (resource: any) => getState(resource).includes('updating');
export const isLoading = (resource: any) => getState(resource).includes('loading');
export const isUndefined = (resource: any) => resource === undefined || getState(resource).length === 0;
export const isReady = (resource: any) => {
  const state = getState(resource);
  return resource && !state.includes('loading') && !state.includes('updating');
};
`;

<CodeSnippet
  title="resourceStates/ResourceState.ts"
  code={code4}
/>

# The trackPromise function

It often happens that the resource state is `updating` while some promise is being executed. For example,
while we are running `deleteTodolists`, the resource state of the affected `todolists` resources should
be `updating`. The `trackPromise` function helps to manage this. While the promise is running, it attaches
a source to the resource state of the affected resources. This source effectively puts these todolists in the
`updating` state. When the promise is resolved, the source is removed.

export const code5 = `
  const todolistsToBeDeleted = [todolist1, todolist2];

  const promise = trackPromise({
    // Add 'updating' to the resource state of the
    // todolists that are being deleted
    states: { updating: [todolistsToBeDeleted] },

    promise: deleteTodoLists.mutateAsync({
      todolistIds: getIds(todolistsToBeDeleted),
    }),
  }).result;
`;

# The graftResourceStatesFromMemo function

When you store resource states inside the resource objects themselves, there is a potential
problem when fresh data is fetched from the server. If you replace the local resource
with the newly fetched one then the local resource state is lost. This is a problem when
you are locally updating a resource, for example: when the resource is being deleted.
To avoid this, we should move the resource state from the old resource to the new resource.
This is what the `graftResourceStatesFromMemo` function does. It's used as follows:

export const code6 = `
  // We're using React.useState to locally store the todolists. This is not what
  // I would use in a real application, but for illustration purposes it's good enough.
  const [todolists, setTodolists] = React.useState<TodolistT[]>([]);

  const graftResourceStatesFromMemo = useGraftResourceStatesFromMemo({});

  React.useEffect(() => {
    getTodolists().then(todolists => {
      setTodolists(graftResourceStatesFromMemo({
        resources: todolists
      });
    });
  })
`;

<CodeSnippet
  title="resourceStates/ResourceState.ts"
  code={code6}
/>

When you pass an array of resources to the `graftResourceStatesFromMemo` function then it stores a memo
of the resource states. The next time you call `graftResourceStatesFromMemo` it will copy the
resource states from the memo to the new resources. This way, the resource states are preserved
when the resources are replaced.

# What's next

In the next chapter we'll look at how we can observe the state of queries and mutations. This is necessary
since resource states usually depend on which queries and mutations are currently running.
