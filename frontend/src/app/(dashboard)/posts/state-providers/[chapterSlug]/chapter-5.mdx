# Conclusion

In this article, I've described how state providers can be used to fetch data and
provide it to the application, including resource states. It also describes a more
high-level design that brings together the concepts of a shared state (e.g.
the `TodolistsState` object) that is built using reusable behaviours
(the `facets` provided by the `Skandha` library) and provided as default properties
(by the `TodolistsStateProvider`, using a `DefaultPropsProvider`).

I intend to create a repository of working sample code that you can install locally
so that you can inspect and play with these ideas. I will update this post when
it's ready.
