The benefit of using default properties as described is that it avoids prop drilling, while still allowing you to customize the property
values that a child component uses. By using nested `DefaultPropsContext` instances, you have a lot of flexibitily in deciding which parts
of the render tree see which default values.
This flexibility comes at a price though: default properties can originate from _any_ `DefaultPropsContext` instance higher up in the tree.
In this sense, it is different from most other React contexts. To put it in another way: when a component declares that it accepts a
default property, it doesn't care where this property comes from, as long as it's provided by a `DefaultPropsContext`.

In my experience, the benefits of this approach outweight the drawbacks. `DefaultPropsContext` allows you to get information
to the place where it is required, without the need to jump through hoops. This results in shorter and more readable code, that is
easier to refactor. Fortunately, in my experience it's rare that default properties are overwritten, which means that reasoning about
these properties is usually easy. If you do need to overwrite the value often, then it can be a signal that prop drilling is more
appropriate for that value.

Since default properties are usually not overwritten, I consider them to be an alternative to React contexts: one that avoids
coupling components to particular contexts or queries. If you want a more traditional approach, then I would recommend to use React contexts
relatively often, especially for data that is widely used in a particular branch of the component tree. Prop drilling is often the best
choice if you want to be explicit about how information is shared between components, so in most applications a combination of
approaches will be needed.
