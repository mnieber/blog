# Goals

To explain an approach for passing React component properties that is a cross between prop drilling
and contexts.

## Source code

The source code that implements this approach is available on [github](https://github.com/mnieber/react-default-props-context)
and can be installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-default-props-context).

## Sample code

There is a sample application, annotated with comments, that explains the approach. Enter the following commands to run it:

export const code1 = `
git clone git@github.com:mnieber/blog-sample-apps.git
cd blog-sample-apps
yarn defaultProps-sample
# Open the browser at http://localhost:3000
`;

<CodeSnippet
  lang="bash"
  addMb
  code={code1}
/>

# Outlook

Passing properties in React application usually happens via prop drilling or React contexts. Both have their pros and cons.
Prop drilling means passing the properties down from the parent to the child component. It has the advantage that the parent
component can control the values that are used by the child component, but it can lead to very verbose code.
The opposite is true when contexts are used: concise code but no control over the properties of the child component.

In this blog post, I will describe a third approach that combines the two: either the property value is
received from the parent component or else the value comes from a DefaultPropsContext. I will refer to this as the "default properties" approach.
