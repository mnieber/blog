# Goals

In this article I will explain how we can add reusable behaviours (such as selection,
filtering, drag-and-drop) to a user interface (UI). These behaviours can have interactions that the UI
components are agnostic about.

# Source code

The source code that this approach is based on is found in the following npm packages:

- `aspiration`
- `skandha`
- `skandha-facets`
- `skandha-mobx`

# Caveats

The approach presented in this article is experimental. It has worked well for me in practice, but
I expect that for many people it's too elaborate to consider using it. That said, I hope you find
this article interesting for the ideas that it puts forward.

# Rationale and overview

Creating a UI takes a lot of effort, but we can save time by using existing solutions.
These solutions can help us in two major ways:

- they render components;
- they add behaviour to these components.

Solution that take care of both rendering and behaviour (we can call these solutions "frameworks") tend
to produce mixed results. If the solution covers the requirements, then it can be very efficient.
However, if the solution must be adapted to get the right result then it can lead to frustration, because
it forces the developer to "fight the framework".

To avoid the risks that come with choosing a framework, you can choose:

- a UI kit for rendering (such as DaisyUI, TailwindUI, Flowbite), and a headless UI solution
  (such as Adobe Aria, Radix, HeadlessUI) for behaviour.
- a headless UI for storing the state of a user-interaction, such as choosing an item from a list. The headless UI
  takes care of processing the related events, such as the mouse-click on a list item.

This article shows how to take this one step further by also considering the interactions between
behaviours. The first section introduces the concepts of containers and facets. Each facet represents a behaviour, and we can connect
facets by mapping data between them. The next section explains how to install callback functions in each facet
to assist with the implementation of the different behaviours. These callback functions allow us to create
interactions between the behaviours. In the final section, I will discuss the pros and cons of this approach.
