# The Selection facet API

We will now examine the Selection facet API more closely, and explain how callbacks are installed that assist in implementing the
facet operations.

export const code1 = `
import { DefineCbs, getCallbacks, stub, withCbs } from 'skandha-facets';

export class Selection<T = any> {
  static className = () => 'Selection';

  @input selectableIds: Array<string> = stub;
  @data ids: Array<string> = [];
  @data anchorId?: string;
  @output items: Array<T> = stub;

  @operation @withCbs() select(args: {
    itemId: string | undefined;
    isShift?: boolean;
    isCtrl?: boolean;
  }) {
    const cbs = getCallbacks(this) as SelectionCbs['select'];
    cbs.selectItem();
  }
};

export type SelectionCbs<T = any> = DefineCbs<
  Selection<T>,
  select: {
    selectItem(): void;
  };
>;
`;

This `Selection` facet is part of the `skandha-facets` library that you can install from npm. However, you can also
write your own facet classes.

As you can see, the `Selection` class has almost no logic. It describes how a selection is stored, and shows the signature
for selecting items, but doesn't specify how selection is implemented. This is by design, so that we can
reuse `Selection` in different scenarios that require different types of selection.

Of course, we do have to implement the `select` operation. This is achieved by implementing the callbacks that are
described in the `SelectionCbs` type.

# The callbacks object

In the body of the `select` operation, we use `getCallbacks` to obtain a so-called callbacks object. This object
(`cbs`) contains:

- all callbacks that the operation requires;
- a copy of the input argument of the operation.

To be able to use the `Selection.select` operation, we must implement all callbacks in `SelectionCbs`.
We'll do this in the `initClips` function, that installs all callbacks for all
facets of `clipsCtr`.

export const code2 = `
export const initClips = (clipsCtr: any) => {
  const ctr = clipsCtr;

  setCallbackMap(ctr.addition, {/* omitted for brevity */} as AdditionCbs<ClipT>);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.deletion, {/* omitted for brevity */} as DeletionCbs);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.edit, {/* omitted for brevity */} as EditCbs);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.highlight, {/* omitted for brevity */} as HighlightCbs);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.insertion, {/* omitted for brevity */} as InsertionCbs);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.move, {/* omitted for brevity */} as MoveCbs);

  setCallbackMap(ctr.selection, {
    select: {
      selectItem(this: SelectionCbs['select']) {
        handleSelectItem(ctr.selection, this.args);

        // Highlight follows selection
        if (!this.args.isCtrl && !this.args.isShift) {
          ctr.highlight.highlightItem({ id: this.args.itemId });
        }
      },
    },
  } as SelectionCbs);
};
`;

The example code shows how the `selectItem` callback is implemented. Remember that `selectItem` is called
when we execute `cbs.selectItem()` in the `select` operation of the `Selection` facet. Inside of `selectItem`,
the `this` variable points to the callbacks object (`cbs`), which contains a copy of the input arguments of the
operation. That is why we can use `this.args` inside `selectItem` to access the selection arguments.

Our callback also takes care of highlighting the selected element. This demonstrates how we can
use a callback to add interactions between behaviours. To get a better impression, I recommend to look at the
sample code mentioned at the beginning of this article.

# Using MobX

I'm a big fan of using MobX for making the UI respond to changes in the UI state. However, I didn't want a
tight coupling between Skandha and MobX. Therefore, there is a separate library called `skandha-mobx` that makes a Skandha
container observable with MobX. It offers a `registerCtr` function that applies `observable` to all
facet data fields, and `computed` to all facet operations.

export const code3 = `
import { registerCtr } from 'skandha-mobx';

registerCtr({
  ctr: clipsCtr,
  options: { name: 'Clips' },
  initCtr: () => {
    initClips(this, props);
    mapClipsData(props);
  }
});
`;

# Connection to Adobe Aria

So far, we haven't discussed how user interactions such as mouse clicks and key-presses are handled. This is the
responsibility of the UI components. When the component receives an event, it should call the correct facet operation.
For example, when the user clicks on an item in a ListBox component, then the component must call the `selection.select()` operation.
I have written generic (reusable) code to make this happen, but I see an opportunity to use a headless UI such as
Adobe Aria:

- the `useListBox()` hook function from Aria creates the event handlers for the ListBox component;
- we listen to state changes in the Aria listbox selection, and call the related facet operation (i.e. `selection.select()`)
  to update the shared UI state;
- when the shared UI state (i.e. `selection.ids`) changes then we update the local Aria state.

In other words: we can synchronize the shared UI state with the local Aria state. This allows us to get the benefits that
Adobe Aria provides.
