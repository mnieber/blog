# The Selection facet API

We will now examine the Selection facet API more closely, and explain how callbacks are installed that assist in implementing the
facet operations.

export const code1 = `
import { DefineCbs, getCallbacks, stub, withCbs } from 'skandha-facets';

export class Selection<T = any> {
  static className = () => 'Selection';

  @input selectableIds: Array<string> = stub;
  @data ids: Array<string> = [];
  @data anchorId?: string;
  @output items: Array<T> = stub;

  @operation @withCbs() select(args: {
    itemId: string | undefined;
    isShift?: boolean;
    isCtrl?: boolean;
  }) {
    const cbs = getCallbacks(this) as SelectionCbs['select'];
    cbs.selectItem();
  }

  type Cbs<T> = {
    select: {
    selectItem(): void;
  };
};

export type SelectionCbs<T = any> = DefineCbs<Selection<T>, Cbs<T>>;
`;

<CodeSnippet title="facets/Selection.ts" code={code1} />

This `Selection` facet is part of the `skandha-facets` library that you can install from npm. However, you can also
write your own facet classes.

As you can see, the `Selection` class has almost no logic. It describes how a selection is stored, and shows the signature
for selecting items, but doesn't specify how selection is implemented. This is by design, because it means that we can
reuse `Selection` in different scenarios that require different types of selection.

# Callback objects

In the body of the `select` operation, we use `getCallbacks` to obtain a so-called callbacks object. This object
(`cbs`) contains:

- all callbacks that the operation requires;
- a copy of the input argument of the operation.

The `cbs` object is of type `SelectionCbs`, which depends on `Cbs`. To be able to use the `Selection.select` operation,
we must implement all callbacks in `Cbs`. We'll do this in the `initClips` function, that installs all callbacks for all
facets of `clipsCtr`.

export const code2 = `
export const initClips = (clipsCtr: any) => {
  const ctr = clipsCtr;

  setCallbackMap(ctr.addition, {/* omitted for brevity */} as AdditionCbs<ClipT>);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.deletion, {/* omitted for brevity */} as DeletionCbs);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.edit, {/* omitted for brevity */} as EditCbs);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.highlight, {/* omitted for brevity */} as HighlightCbs);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.insertion, {/* omitted for brevity */} as InsertionCbs);
  setCallbackMap(ctr.move, {/* omitted for brevity */} as MoveCbs);

  setCallbackMap(ctr.selection, {
    select: {
      selectItem(this: SelectionCbs['select']) {
        handleSelectItem(ctr.selection, this.args);

        // Highlight follows selection
        if (!this.args.isCtrl && !this.args.isShift) {
          ctr.highlight.highlightItem({ id: this.args.itemId });
        }
      },
    },
  } as SelectionCbs);
};
`;

<CodeSnippet title="clips/initClips.ts" code={code2} />

As was mentioned above, the `cbs` object contains a copy of the input arguments of the operation. That is
why we can use `this.args` inside the call to `setCallbackMap` to access the selection arguments.
The callback we installed also takes care of highlighting the selected element. This shows how we can
use a callback to add interactions between behaviours.

# Using MobX

I'm a big fan of using MobX for making the UI respond to changes in the UI state. Therefore, there is a
separate library called `skandha-mobx` that offers a `registerCtr` function that applies `observable` to all
facet data fields, and `computed` to all operations.

export const code3 = `
import { registerCtr } from 'skandha-mobx';

registerCtr({
  ctr: clipsCtr,
  options: { name: 'Clips' },
  initCtr: () => {
  initClips(this, props);
  mapClipsData(props);
});
`;

# Connection to Adobe Aria

So far, we haven't discussed how user interactions such as mouse clicks and key-presses are handled. This is the
responsibility of the UI components. When the component receives an event, it should call the correct facet operation.
For example, when the user clicks on an item in a ListBox component, then the component must call the `selection.select()` operation.
I have written reusable code to make this happen, but I see an opportunity to use a headless ui such as
Adobe Aria:

- the `useListBox()` hook function from Aria creates the event handlers for the ListBox component;
- we listen to state changes in the Aria listbox selection, and call the related facet operation (i.e. `selection.select()`)
  to update the shared UI state;
- when the shared UI state (i.e. `selection.ids`) changes then we update the local Aria state.

In other words: we synchronize the shared UI state with the local Aria state. This allows us to get the benefits that
Adobe Aria provides.
