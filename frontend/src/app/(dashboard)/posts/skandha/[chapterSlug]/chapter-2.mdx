# Storing UI state in containers

For storing the UI state of an application we have two choices: inside the UI component, or externally.
I prefer to store UI state in so-called containers that are separate from the UI component functions, for three reasons:

- it helps to keep the code of the UI components simple;
- it allows to share the UI state between several UI components (this usually turns out to be necessary);
- it makes it easier to program interactions between behaviours such as selection, filtering, addition, etc.

In the remainder of this article I will elaborate on these points. To explain my approach for storing the UI state,
I will use the example of Vidlito (video-list-tool): an application that allows people to store collections of playlists that contain video clips.
Broadly speaking, my approach is the following:

- I store UI state in containers (e.g. `playlistsCtr`, and `clipsCtr`).
- Each container contains facets. A facet is an object that stores a particular type of UI state such as selection, filtering, drag-and-drop, etc.
- You can map data between facets. For example, the output of the filtering facet is used as the input of the selection facet, so that you can
  only select clips that were not filtered out.
- Facets have operations that accept callback functions. These callback functions assist in implementing the operation, but they also allow us
  to create interactions between behaviours. For example, the `applyFilter` callback of the filtering facet can automatically correct the
  highlight, so that the highlighted clip is not hidden by the filter.

# An example container

Let's look at the code for `clipsCtr` and its facets, as well as the `mapClipsData` function that maps data between these facets.

<TabView titles={["PlaylistsState/index.ts", "PlaylistsState/mapClipsData.ts"]}>
<CodeSnippet
  code={`
  import { Addition, Deletion /* other imports omitted for brevity */ } from 'skandha-facets';

const clipsCtr = {
addition: new Addition<ClipT>(),
deletion: new Deletion(),
display: new Display<ClipT>(),
dragAndDrop: new DragAndDrop(),
edit: new Edit(),
filtering: new Filtering<ClipT>(),
highlight: new Highlight<ClipT>(),
insertion: new Insertion<ClipT>(),
// This facet is used to move a clip to another playlist
move: new Move(),
selection: new Selection<ClipT>(),
store: new Store<ClipT>(),
};
}
`}
/>

<CodeSnippet
  code={`
  import { mapDataToProps } from 'skandha';

export function mapClipsData(clipsCtr) {
const ctr = clipsCtr;

    mapDataToProps(ctr, {
      display: { items: () => ctr.insertion.preview },
      filtering: { inputItems: () => ctr.store.items ?? [ ] },
      highlight: {
        highlightableIds: () => getIds(ctr.display.items),
        item: () => getClipById(ctr.highlight.id),
      },
      insertion: {
        inputItems: () => ctr.filtering.outputItems,
        preview: () => { /* omitted for brevity */ },
      selection: {
        selectableIds: () => getIds(ctr.display.items),
        items: () => ctr.selection.ids.map(getClipById).filter((x?: ClipT) => !!x) as ClipT[],
      },
    });

}
`}
/>

</TabView>

## Purpose of the selection facet

Each facet has its own API that contains data fields and operations. For example, the `selection` facet has fields
`ids`, `selectableIds`, `anchorId` and `items`, as well as the `select` operation (we will take a closer look
in the next section). You can think of the `Selection` facet class as an abstraction: a very general description of what
selections look like and how they are used. Like all abstractions, this helps with promoting code consistency and reuse:
regardless of how selection is implemented, it will look the same everywhere in the application.
It also means we can create reusable helper functions that take a selection as their argument.

## Using mapDataToProps to connect facets

In many cases, the output of one facet is used as the input of another facet. Therefore, we can use the `mapDataToProps`
function to map data between facets. This function patches a facet by
replacing a data field by a `get` property. For example, the `ctr.selection.selectableIds` field is replaced by a
property that returns `getIds(ctr.display.items)`.
