# Introduction

As mentioned in the previous chapter, it's often a good idea to start a design with inline components
(snippets of JSX code that have inline styles) and then move repeated code to custom components. Custom components
work well when the code that appears in multiple places is highly similar. For example, dialog buttons usually look
similar to each other, with some variation in sizes and colours that can be captured in the parameters of a custom
component.

An example of where it's harder to use a custom component is a form. Different forms will share some features,
such as labels, titles, and subtitles but there can also be major differences between them that make it hard
to support all use-cases with a single component.

In this chapter, I will use the component snippet from chapter 2 as a starting point. I will discuss how the
code can be decluttered by moving a subset of the styles to an .scss file, and explain how a style object
can be used to capture common patterns in the remaining styles without introducing a full-blown custom component.

# Breaking out intrinsic styles

To add a new component we can copy a TailwindUI snippet and adjust it to suit the local context. For the purpose
of understanding the code, the styles that are most important are those that affect the layout. We can verify that a particular
margin or padding is correct by relating it to the margins and paddings of neighouring components. I will use the term
"ad-hoc styles" for these context-dependent and "intrinsic styles" for the context-independent ones. To reduce code clutter,
intrinsic styles can be moved to an .scss file.

There is no formal rule for deciding which styles are intrinsic. From a design perspective, most styles - including
colors and font-weights - are context dependent. However, when I'm verifying the code I'm usually interested in the layout, and therefore
I will move colors and font-weights to the .scss file. In general, I trust that the reader will intuitively understand why
certain styles are in the .scss file and others are not. In less obvious situations, such as when a margin appears in the SCSS file,
it's helpful to include a comment.

Let's look at an example of splitting instrinsic and ad-hoc styles:

- the email-field code snippet from the previous chapter has been copied to the body of a SignInForm component;
- the intrinsic styles are captured in a SCSS file as `SignInForm__EmailFieldLabel` and `SignInForm__EmailFieldInput`;

export const code1 = `
import { classnames as cn } from 'classnames';

type PropsT = {};

export const SignInForm = (props: PropsT) => {
  return (
    <div className={cn("SignInForm__EmailField", ["mb-6"])}>
      <label
        for="email"
        className={cn("SignInForm__EmailFieldLabel", ["mb-2"])}
      >
        Email address
      </label>
      <div>
        <input
          id="email" name="email" type="email"
          className={cn("SignInForm__EmailFieldInput", ["py-1.5"])}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
`;

export const code2 = `
.SignInForm\_\_EmailField {}

.SignInForm\_\_EmailFieldLabel {
  @apply block text-sm font-medium leading-6 text-gray-900;
}

.SignInForm\_\_EmailFieldInput {
  @apply block rounded-md border-0 shadow-sm;
  @apply text-gray-900 placeholder:text-gray-400 sm:text-sm sm:leading-6;
  @apply ring-1 ring-inset ring-gray-300 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-inset focus:ring-indigo-600;
}
`;

  <CodeSnippet code={code1} />
  <CodeSnippet lang="sass" code={code2} />
</TabView>

# Style objects

The ad-hoc styles typically involve the component's layout and geometry, such as flex-box properties, margins, heights, widths, and
paddings. Because they are inlined, ad-hoc properties can easily be adjusted to fit a specific context. Still, it's good for consistency to
limit the variation in these properties. For instance, if an email field has a vertical padding of 1.5, then it's likely that the password field
 has the same padding. To address this, I extract the ad-hoc properties and place them in a style object:

export const code3 = `
import { classnames as cn } from 'classnames';

export const SignInForm = () => {
  return (
    ...
    <div className={cn(FormFieldS.root(), "SignInForm__EmailField")}
    >
      <label
        for="email"
        className={cn(FormFieldS.Label(), "SignInForm__EmailFieldLabel")}
      >
        Email address
      </label>
      <div>
        <input
          id="email" name="email" type="email"
          className={cn(FormFieldS.Input(), "SignInForm__EmailFieldInput")}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
`;

export const code4 = `
export const FormFieldS = {
  // The "root" style adds the styles for the FormField container
  root: () => 'mb-6',
  // Use this style if the form-field contains a label
  Label: () => 'mb-2',
  // Use this style if the form-field contains an input
  Input: () => 'py-1.5',
};
`;

  <CodeSnippet code={code3} />
  <CodeSnippet code={code4} />
</TabView>

I think of a style object as a loosely defined custom component that I can mix into my concrete components.
For example, when we add the `SignInForm__EmailFieldLabel` to our code, we can declare that it's a `FormField.Label`
by mixing in this part of the style object. As indicated by the comments, it's not mandatory to use all the keys in the layout object.
For example, the `Label` key is only utilized if the form-field includes a label.

We can achieve the same result by mixing in CSS classes, but in my opinion that doesn't work quite as well:

- since a CSS mixin class can be used in any CSS selector, it opens the door to more complex code;
- we can easily jump to the style object in our IDE, but not so easily to a CSS mixin;
- we can create hierarchies within a style object (as we shall see below), but not in SCSS.

# Adding choices to a style object

The logical next step is to have style objects that offer a choice of paddings, colours, title styles,
subtitle styles, etc from which we can choose when we create a concrete component. This is reminiscent of the design systems that we may
use in tools such as Figma. Here's an example:

export const code5 = `
import { classnames as cn } from 'classnames';

export const SignInForm = () => {
  return (
    <div className="SignInForm">
      <div className={cn(
        FormFieldS.root(),
        FormFieldS.gap.big(),
        "SignInForm__EmailField"
      )}>
        <label
          for="email"
          className={cn(
            FormFieldS.Label.root(),
            FormFieldS.Label.color.blue(),
            "SignInForm__EmailFieldLabel"
          )}
        >
          Email address
        </label>
        <div>
          <input
            id="email" name="email" type="email"
            className={cn(
              FormFieldS.Input(),
              "SignInForm__EmailFieldInput"
            )}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
`;

export const code6 = `
import "./FormField.scss";

export const FormFieldS = {
  root: () => '',
  // Use one of the gap styles to create space below the form-field
  gap: {
    big: () => 'mb-6',
    small: () => 'mb-2',
  },
  Label: {
    root: () => 'mb-2',
    // Pick one color for the label
    color: {
      blue: () => 'text-blue-500',
      green: () => 'text-green-400',
    }
  }
  Input: () => 'py-1.5',
};
`;

# Adding intrinsic styles to a style object

If we always combine a style object with the same intrinsic styles then it makes sense
to include them in the style object. In the updated code below, the `SignInForm__EmailFieldLabel` and
`SignInForm__EmailFieldInput` classes are replaced by `FormField__Label` and
`FormField__Input`.

export const code7 = `
import { classnames as cn } from 'classnames';

export const SignInForm = () => {
  return (
    <div className="SignInForm">
      <div className={cn(FormFieldS.root(), FormFieldS.gap.big())}>
        <label
          for="email"
          className={cn(FormFieldS.Label.root(), FormFieldS.Label.color.blue())}
        >
          Email address
        </label>
        <div>
          <input
            id="email" name="email" type="email"
            className={cn(FormFieldS.Input())}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
`;

export const code8 = `
import "./FormField.scss";

export const FormFieldS = {
  root: () => 'FormField',
  gap: {
    big: () => 'mb-6',
    small: () => 'mb-2',
  },
  Label: {
    root: () => cn('FormField__Label', 'mb-2'),
    color: {
      blue: () => 'text-blue-500',
      green: () => 'text-green-400',
    }
  }
  Input: () => cn('FormField__Input', 'py-1.5'),
};
`;

export const code9 = `
.FormField {
  .FormField\_\_Label {
    @apply block text-sm font-medium leading-6 text-gray-900;
  }

  .FormField\_\_Input {
    @apply block rounded-md border-0 shadow-sm;
    @apply text-gray-900 placeholder:text-gray-400 sm:text-sm sm:leading-6;
    @apply ring-1 ring-inset ring-gray-300 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-inset focus:ring-indigo-600;
  }
}
`;
