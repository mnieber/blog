In this article I've explained a hybrid approach for writing style related code. This approach relies on
style objects to capture the styles that are commonly used for a group of components, such as dialog buttons.
Trim objects are type-checked, which ensures that we don't forget to apply some of these styles. By
setting the `trim` property of a component, we can easily change its appearance. I still find it useful
to place the intrinsic styles in a .scss file, but you don't have to.

I've used this approach succesfully in my Vidlito application, and I like it a lot. However, it is still experimental,
and I will continue to use it to better understand its pros and cons. If you want a more proven approach, then I would go
with inline styles using a library like TailwindUI, DaisyUI, HyperUI or FlowBite. However, also in this case,
you will probably move code to custom components, and then the ideas I've outlined here may prove to be useful.
