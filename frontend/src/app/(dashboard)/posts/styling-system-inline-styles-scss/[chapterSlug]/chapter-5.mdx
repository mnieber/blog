In this article I've explained a hybrid approach for writing style related code. It tries to retain the advantages
of using inline styles, but using more reusable and DRY code. I've used this approach succesfully in my Vidlito application,
but it is still experimental, and I will continue to use it to better understand its pros and cons.

If you want a more proven approach, then I would go with inline styles using a library like TailwindUI, DaisyUI, HyperUI 
or FlowBite. However, also in this case, you will probably move code to custom components, and then the ideas I've outlined
here may prove to be useful.
