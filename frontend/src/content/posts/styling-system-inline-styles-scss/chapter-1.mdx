# Goals

I will explain a hybrid approach - based on inline styles and SCSS - for writing style-related code that is compact,
flexible and maintainable.

# Assumptions

You are familiar with the basics of SCSS and inline styles.

# Caveats

First, this article describes an experimental approach. I think it contains interesting ideas, and can be of practical
value, but it's not a proven approach. Second, although I've used CSS a lot, I'm not an expert.
I will discuss some of my experiences with inline styles, SCSS and CSS-in-JS but I can't make a strong case for
which approaches should be preferred.

# Conventions

I will sometimes use the terms HTML and JSX interchangeably (since JSX is a way to write HTML inside Typescript).

# Why do we need a style system?

A large fraction of the code is related to styling the application. To make this code maintainable, it needs to be
well structured and predictable. A style system can help us to achieve that. It tells us how styles are defined,
how styles are applied to elements, and how they are adapted to different contexts (e.g. the current theme). Without a system,
it's very likely that different solutions will be used in different places, which will make it harder
to understand and maintain the code.

# Overview

In this article I will share my thoughts on writing style code. I will start by discussing various approaches for creating
UIs: TailwindUI, SCSS, UIkit, CSS-in-JS and MaterialUI. I will discuss what I like and dislike about these approaches,
and explain what qualities I aim for in a style system. Then, I will introduce my own hybrid approach for implementing styles.
