In this article I've explained a hybrid approach for writing style related code. It tries to retain the advantages
of using inline styles, but using more reusable and DRY code. The approach is still experimental, and I will be
using it in my projects to better understand its pros and cons. I you need a solid choice, then I would go with
inline styles using a library like TailwindUI, DaisyUI, HyperUI or FlowBite.
