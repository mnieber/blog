The benefit of using default properties as described is that it avoids prop drilling, while still allowing you to customize the property
values that a child component uses. By using nested DefaultPropsContext instances, you have a lot of flexibitily in deciding which parts
of the render tree see which default values.
This flexibility comes at a price though: default properties can originate from _any_ DefaultPropsContext instance higher up in the tree.
In this sense, it is different from most other React contexts. To put it in another way: when a component declares that it accepts a
default property, it doesn't care where this property comes from, as long as it's provided by a DefaultPropsContext.

In my experience, the benefits of this approach easily outweight the drawbacks. `DefaultPropsContext` allows you to get information
to the place where it is required, without the need to jump through hoops. This results in shorter and more readable code, that is
easier to refactor. So if prop drilling in your code gets out of hand, I would recommend to give this a try.
