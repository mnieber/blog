# Goals

To explain how a technical product roadmap can be more effective than a product backlog for planning a software project,
specifiying its high-level requirements and creating team alignment.

# Overview

To effectively work together as a software development team it is vital that the team is aligned
on the product vision and planning, both in the short and medium term. This includes:

- understanding the user requirements so that it's clear what the product tries to achieve;
- sharing an ubiqitous language so that key terms have the same meaning to all team members;
- having a shared awareness of the product development plan, so that team members do not
  work at cross purposes.

Almost all companies I have worked with struggle with creating this alignment. Teams often rely on the
product backlog to create a shared understanding of the upcoming steps, but as I explain in the next chapter
this approach fails to produce good results. As an alternative, I will introduce a particular type of
roadmap document, including a small example, and discuss how it can aid team alignment and planning.
